# First Level

## Introduction

This app is my React Frontend project as part of The Jump Digital School's 14th cohort Software Engineering Course. It uses the [RAWG Video Games Database API](https://rawg.io/apidocs) to fetch data and other assets on video games to display to the user.

## User Stories

-See a dashboard where they can filter by new releases/upcoming games and see a top 10 list of highly rated games

- Click on each game and be taken to the game detail, including a description, screenshots, trailers, etc
- Like games to save to local storage and view on a favorites page
- Delete games from local storage/favorites
- Visit a search page and query/filter results name, genre and more using search and select inputs
